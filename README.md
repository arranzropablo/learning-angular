# Learning Angular

This repository contains the web-apps i have developed as a part of an Angular course on Udemy.<br>
(shout out to https://www.udemy.com/angular-2-fernando-herrera).<br>

Each "section" finishes with a developed project where the acquired knowledge is shown off.

Index:<br>
1.helloWorld: Final project is a simple app where we can find examples of components (created via CLI and manually), ngIf and ngFor.<br>
