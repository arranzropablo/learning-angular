# Learning Angular

This repository contains the web-apps i have developed as a part of an Angular course on Udemy.<br>
(shout out to https://www.udemy.com/angular-2-fernando-herrera).<br>

Each "section" finishes with a developed project where the acquired knowledge is shown off.

Index:<br><br>
<b>1. helloWorld:</b> Simple app made as a "hello world" where we can find examples of components (created via CLI and manually), ngIf and ngFor.<br><br>
<b>2. simpsons-app:</b> First SPA made. This app contains a navbar which you can use to navigate to "characters" section or to search any simpsons character you want (among those which I've included). With this app I've learnt how to use components (more deeply than in "helloWorld"),  services and routing.<br><br>
<b>3. pipes:</b> This is a simple app made to learn how pipes work and how to design our own pipes. It consists of a table with a column where we can see the original string, a column where we can see the pipe we applied, and a column with the final result.
<b>4. spoti-app:</b> SPA which use Spotify's API and widget. It has a home page with images into a carousel and a search page where artists are shown at the time we write the search term. If we click on an artist we can see a button which links us to his spotify page and his top tracks (This part might not work properly as Auth0 Token needs to be asked when certain time passed... Spotify client needs to be installed, etc...)
